This project was bootstrapped using a project base of [HectorBliss](https://github.com/HectorBlisS/Curso-React-Redux-GraphQL.git) and modifying updating the following:

    - React 16 to React 18
    - CRA to Vite
    - React Router Dom v5 to React Router Dom V6
    - Add TypeScript support

## Available Scripts

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`
